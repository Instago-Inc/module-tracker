## v1.0.1 - Tracker Docs & Binding Refresh
Tracker usage guidance now focuses on tracking change flows and the updated binding versions for more reliable snapshots across monitoring runs.

### Changed
- Rewrote the main README to emphasize change-tracking workflows, export expectations, and usage tips for `trackPage` / `trackPages`.
- Bumped the native `browser`, `b64`, and `diff` requires to `@latest` so the module references the freshest bindings.
